After a while of walking along the riverbank, you come across a rickety old bridge spanning the water. It looks unstable, but it's your only option if you want to continue following the river.

With each step, you feel the bridge sway, but you press on, determined to find out where this river leads. Suddenly, halfway across, you hear a loud snap, and before you can react, the bridge collapses, sending you plummeting into the icy waters below. You struggle to stay afloat, but the current is too strong, pulling you under. As you desperately gasp for air, darkness envelops you. You have met a watery demise.",
